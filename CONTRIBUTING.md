# Contributing to `panther-analysis`

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Panther's open-source ruleset!  We appreciate all types of contributions, including new detection rules, feature requests, and bug reports.

## What makes a good detection?

Please familiarize yourself with these helpful resources on writing high-quality Panther rules:

- The blog post Panther's founder, Jack Naglieri, wrote on [The Anatomy of a High Quality SIEM Rule](https://jacknaglieri.substack.com/p/hq-siem-rules)
- Panther's [Detection Documentation](https://docs.panther.com/detections)
- The `panther-analysis` [Style Guide](https://github.com/panther-labs/panther-analysis/blob/main/style_guides/STYLE_GUIDE.md)

Especially excellent contributions will be considered for a quarterly prize! We will announce a winner in the **Panther-Analysis Seasonal Newsletter**, where we share updates and celebrate contributions to Pantherâ€™s open-source ruleset.
