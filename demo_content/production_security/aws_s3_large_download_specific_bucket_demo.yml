    - "TA0010:T1537"  # Exfiltration: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
Description: >
  Detects when a user (IAM User, AssumedRole, or FederatedUser) downloads more than the 
  configured threshold of data from S3 buckets within a time window. Configurable thresholds 
  and bucket filtering allow customization for different organizational needs. This may 
  indicate unauthorized data exfiltration or bulk data downloads for analysis.

  1. Query for complete list of objects downloaded (not just the sample) and examine the purpose of the files related to the requestor
  2. Validate if source_ip appears in threat intelligence or ipinfo enrichments
  3. Check for other AWS API activity from this user/role during the same timeframe
