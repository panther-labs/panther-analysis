  MITRE ATT&CK:
    - "TA0010:T1537"  # Exfiltration: Transfer Data to Cloud Account
Description: >
  Detects when a user (IAM User, AssumedRole, or FederatedUser) downloads more than the 
  configured threshold of data from S3 buckets within a time window. Configurable thresholds 
  and bucket filtering allow customization for different organizational needs. This may 
  indicate unauthorized data exfiltration or bulk data downloads for analysis.
DedupPeriodMinutes: 60
Runbook: |
  1. **Immediate Actions:**
     - Verify if the user activity is authorized
     - Check if the downloads were for legitimate business purposes
     - Consider temporarily restricting bucket access if suspicious
  
  2. **Investigation Steps:**
     - Review the user's recent authentication events
     - Check for any privilege escalation or credential compromise
     - Examine the downloaded objects to determine sensitivity
     - Review source IP and user agent for signs of automation
     - Check for other suspicious activities by the same user
  
  3. **Containment:**
     - If unauthorized: revoke user credentials immediately
     - Apply temporary S3 bucket policies to restrict access
     - Enable S3 MFA delete and additional monitoring
  
  4. **Recovery:**
     - Document the scope of data accessed
     - Review S3 access logs for complete activity timeline
     - Consider rotating any sensitive data that may have been accessed
  
  5. **Prevention:**
     - Implement S3 access monitoring and alerting
     - Review IAM policies for least privilege
     - Consider S3 Access Points for controlled access
     - Enable GuardDuty for enhanced threat detection
