QueryName: Pod creation or modification to a Host Path Volume Mount
Enabled: false
Tags:
  - Optional
Description: >
  This detection monitors for pod creation with a hostPath volume mount. The attachment to a node's volume can allow for privilege escalation through underlying vulnerabilities or it can open up possibilities for data exfiltration or unauthorized file access. It is very rare to see this being a pod requirement.
