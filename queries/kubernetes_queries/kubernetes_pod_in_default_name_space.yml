Description: >
  This detection monitors for any pod created in pre-configured or default namespaces. Only Cluster Admins should be creating pods in the kube-system namespace, and it is best practice not to run any cluster critical infrastructure here. The kube-public namespace is intended to be readable by unauthenticated users. The default namespace is shipped with the cluster and it is best practice not to deploy production workloads here. These namespaces may be used to evade defenses or hide attacker infrastructure.
