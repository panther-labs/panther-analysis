QueryName: Pod Created or Modified Using the Host IPC Namespace
Enabled: true
Tags:
  - Optional
Description: >
  This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host IPC Namespace. Deploying pods in the Host IPC Namespace, breaks isolation between the pod and the underlying host meaning the pod has direct access to the same IPC objects and communications channels as the host system.
