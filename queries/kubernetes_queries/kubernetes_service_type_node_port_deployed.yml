DisplayName: "Kubernetes Service with Type Node Port Deployed"
Description: >
  This detection monitors for any kubernetes service deployed with type node port. A Node Port service allows an attacker to expose a set of pods hosting the service to the internet by opening their port and redirecting traffic here. This can be used to bypass network controls and intercept traffic, creating a direct line to the outside network.
