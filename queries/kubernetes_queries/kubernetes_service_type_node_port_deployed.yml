Description: >-
  This detection monitors for any kubernetes service deployed with type node port.
  A Node Port service allows an attacker to expose a set of pods hosting the service
  to the internet by opening their port and redirecting traffic here. This can be
  used to bypass network controls and intercept traffic, creating a direct line to
  the outside network.
