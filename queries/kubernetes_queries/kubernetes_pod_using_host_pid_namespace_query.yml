QueryName: Pod Created or Modified Using the Host PID Namespace
Enabled: true
Tags:
  - Optional
Description: >
  This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host PID namespace. The Host PID namespace enables a pod and its containers to have direct access and share the same view as of the host’s processes. This can offer a powerful escape hatch to the underlying host.
