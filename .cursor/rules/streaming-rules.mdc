Create Panther security detection rules to identify suspicious behaviors or compliance violations.

# System Context
1. Panther detections contain two files: a `.py` file for detection logic and a `.yml` file for metadata.
2. Rules are stateless and only process one `event` at a time.
3. Alert thresholds default to `1`. Set this value to the minimum acceptable number of repetetive actions (for example, 5 failed logins).
4. Panther adds metadata fields (`p_field_name`) or indicator fields `p_any_ioc_field` to events after classification. For example: `p_log_type` contains the classified log type.

# Development Workflow
1. **Understand the threat** - What behavior are you detecting?
2. **Research schema and data** - Read log type schemas to validate field names and structures, check data models for field mappings, and sample real log events for accurate testing
3. **Write logic + tests** - Basic conditions with positive/negative test cases using real log data
4. **Optimize and configure** - Performance, severity, dedup, documentation

# Rule Functions

## Required
* `rule(event: dict) -> bool`: Detection logic - returns True if event matches criteria
* `title(event: dict) -> str`: Alert title for grouping (**avoid making too unique**)

## Optional
* `dedup(event: dict) -> str`: Custom deduplication key
* `alert_context(event: dict) -> dict`: Key fields for alert context

## Dynamic (use with conditional logic)
* `runbook(event: dict) -> str`: Triage steps for AI agent
* `severity(event: dict) -> str`: Dynamic severity (INFO, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
* `destinations(event: dict) -> List[str]`: Dynamic alert destinations

## Third-party libraries
The following third-party Python libraries are available in the runtime environment:
1. `jsonpath-ng`: JSONPath Implementation
2. `policyuniverse`: Parse AWS ARNs and Policies
3. `requests`: Easy HTTP Requests

## Helper functions
The `global_helpers/` folder contains a set of convinience functions for analyzing specific logs that may be imported and used in rules.

# Rule Metadata
The YML file follows the rule schema definition. For complete field specifications and validation rules, refer to [rule.json](mdc:mcp:.vscode/schemas/rule.json)

**SummaryAttributes:** To use a nested field as a summary attribute, use the Snowflake dot notation in the Summary Attribute field to traverse a path in a JSON object (e.g., `userIdentity.arn` for nested AWS CloudTrail fields).

# Best Practices
- Follow PEP8 Python coding style
- Only assign variables when re-use is needed
- Order conditions by selectivity: Put the most restrictive conditions first to leverage short-circuit evaluation
- Use early returns: Exit rule() as soon as a condition fails to avoid unnecessary computation
- Use `event.get()` to safely access fields that may not exist: `bucket_name = event.get('requestParameters')` (event fields are NOT case sensitive)
- Use `event.deep_get()` to safely access nested fields: `bucket_name = event.deep_get('requestParameters', 'bucketName')`
- Use `event.deep_walk()` to retrieve values that are deeply nested in dictionaries
- Use appropriate deduplication to prevent alert flooding
- Include comprehensive runbooks for effective triage

## Alert Configuration

**Severity Levels:**
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate response (data breach, privilege escalation)
- **HIGH**: Urgent investigation (suspicious activity, policy violations)
- **MEDIUM**: Standard investigation (unusual behavior, compliance)
- **LOW/INFO**: Informational or signals only

**Deduplication Windows:**
- **15 min**: High-frequency events (login failures, API calls)
- **60 min**: Standard security events (privilege changes, data access)
- **180 min**: Compliance events
- **720 min**: Low-frequency events (account creation)
- **1440 min**: Rare events (root account usage)

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
- Don't implement thresholding in rule logic (Panther handles this)
- Don't make titles too unique (causes alert fragmentation)
- Don't access fields without safe methods (causes KeyError exceptions)
- Don't use complex nested logic (hurts performance and readability)

# Testing Strategy

Include at least one positive and negative test case. Use real log data when possible.

**Mock Functions (within test objects):**
```yaml
Tests:
  - Name: Test With Mock
    ExpectedResult: true
    Mocks:
      - objectName: get_counter
        returnValue: 1
    Log: {...}
```

# Signals

A special mode of a Rule where no alert is generated, but events are labeled with the matching Rule ID. This is useful for security-relevant logs, but not behaviors that warrant immediate alerts.

If a user asks to create a Signal, then:
1. Set `CreateAlert` to false
2. Set `Severity` to INFO
3. Only include the rule() method in the `.py` file
4. Ignore alert-related metadata like deduplication

    return (
        event.get("eventName") == "CreateAccessKey"
        and event.get("eventSource") == "iam.amazonaws.com"
        and aws_cloudtrail_success(event)
        and (
            not event.deep_get("userIdentity", "arn", default="").endswith(
                f"user/{event.deep_get('responseElements', 'accessKey', 'userName', default='')}"
            )
        )
    )


def title(event):
    return (
        f"[{event.deep_get('userIdentity','arn')}]"
        " created API keys for "
        f"[{event.deep_get('responseElements','accessKey','userName', default = '')}]"
    )


def runbook(event):
    return f"""
    Query CloudTrail activity from the new access key ({event.deep_get("responseElements", "accessKey", "accessKeyId", default="key not found")}) at least 2 hours after the alert was triggered and check for data access or other privilege escalation attempts using the aws_cloudtrail table.
    """


def alert_context(event):
    return aws_rule_context(event)
```
