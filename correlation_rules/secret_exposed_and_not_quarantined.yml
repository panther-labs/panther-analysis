Description: The rule detects when a GitHub Secret Scan detects an exposed secret, which is not followed by the expected quarantine operation in AWS.  When you make a repository public, or push changes to a public repository, GitHub always scans the code for secrets that match partner patterns. Public packages on the npm registry are also scanned. If secret scanning detects a potential secret, we notify the service provider who issued the secret. The service provider validates the string and then decides whether they should revoke the secret, issue a new secret, or contact you directly. Their action will depend on the associated risks to you or them.
