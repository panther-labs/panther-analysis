Description: >-
  In April 2024, Mandiant received threat intelligence on database records that were
  subsequently determined to have originated from a victim’s Snowflake instance. Mandiant
  notified the victim, who then engaged Mandiant to investigate suspected data theft
  involving their Snowflake instance. During this investigation, Mandiant determined
  that the organization’s Snowflake instance had been compromised by a threat actor
  using credentials previously stolen via infostealer malware. The threat actor used
  these stolen credentials to access the customer’s Snowflake instance and ultimately
  exfiltrate valuable data. At the time of the compromise, the account did not have
  multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.
