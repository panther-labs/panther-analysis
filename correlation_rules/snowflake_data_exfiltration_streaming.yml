Description: >
  This correlation rule detects a multi-step data exfiltration sequence from Snowflake databases by identifying when a temporary stage is created, table data is copied into that stage, and files are subsequently downloaded from the stage. This technique was notably used in the April 2024 Snowflake breach where threat actor UNC5537 (tracked by Mandiant) compromised multiple organizations' Snowflake instances using credentials stolen via infostealer malware. The threat actors exploited accounts without multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled to access Snowflake instances and exfiltrate valuable data including customer records, financial information, and proprietary business data. The exfiltration workflow involves creating a temporary staging location within Snowflake, using COPY INTO commands to export table data to the stage, and then downloading the staged files to attacker-controlled infrastructure. This detection identifies the complete kill chain from staging preparation through data extraction, providing high-confidence evidence of active data theft. Legitimate uses of temporary stages and COPY INTO commands exist for ETL operations and data migration, but the correlation of all three steps within a short timeframe combined with contextual indicators (unusual users, IP addresses, or timing) strongly suggests malicious exfiltration activity. Organizations should investigate these alerts immediately as successful data exfiltration can lead to extortion attempts, competitive intelligence theft, regulatory violations, and significant reputational damage.
Runbook: |
  1. Query Snowflake's QUERY_HISTORY and ACCESS_HISTORY views for the stage name in p_alert_context.stage to identify the user account, session ID, source IP addresses, client application, and all tables that were copied into the stage
  2. Review the specific tables copied into the stage to determine data sensitivity (PII, financial records, intellectual property) and estimate the volume of data exfiltrated, then check Snowflake's LOGIN_HISTORY to verify if the user account had MFA enabled
  3. Analyze the source IP addresses used during the exfiltration sequence against threat intelligence feeds to determine if they are corporate IPs, suspicious cloud providers, or known malicious infrastructure, and check for impossible travel patterns
