Description: >
  Detects when a pull_request_target workflow contains a checkout action, creating a potential
  security risk. pull_request_target workflows run with elevated privileges and have access to
  repository secrets even when triggered by external contributors from forks. When combined with
  a checkout action, this can create dangerous attack vectors. This is a well-known technique for
  supply chain compromise in GitHub Actions, often called a "pwn request". 
Runbook: |
  0: Assess Actual Severity
    - Check if this was triggered by a cross-fork PR. Cross-fork PRs are significantly more dangerous as any GitHub user can submit them.
  1. Review the workflow file immediately to determine the security impact
  2. Check what the checkout action is checking out:
     - Look for 'ref' parameter in the checkout step in .github/workflows/
     - PR head checkout should be treated as higher severity as untrusted code can be executed with the wokflow secrets (ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}). If no ref is specified in the workflow, the default is the PR head.
     - Base branch checkout (ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}) or ${{ github.base_ref }} can be treated as medium severity. They are generally safer but can still be vulnerable.
  3. Verify if the workflow uses untrusted PR context data (even with base branch checkout):
     - Check for: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}, .body, .head_ref, .user.login, etc.
     - These can inject malicious commands even when code is trusted
     - If found, carefully review workflow and PR logs to determine malicious intent.
  4. Check if workflow executes code from the checked-out repository:
     - Build scripts, tests, or any arbitrary code execution
     - npm install, pip install, or dependency installations from checked out code
     - If yes with PR head checkout, this should be treated as a higher severity alert.
  5. Review workflow permissions and secret access:
     - Check GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
     - Identify which secrets are accessible
     - Higher risk if write permissions or sensitive secrets present
  7. Immediate mitigation if vulnerable:
     - Review and consider disabling
     - Switch to pull_request event if elevated privileges aren't needed
     - Implement explicit checkout of trusted refs only
     - Sanitize all PR context variables before use
  8. Review PR author and changes for signs of malicious intent
  9. Check workflow run logs for suspicious activity or exfiltration attempts
