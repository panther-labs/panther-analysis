Description: >
  The “download artifacts” API, and various custom actions encapsulating it, 
  doesn’t differentiate between artifacts that were uploaded by forked repositories 
  and base repositories, which could lead privileged workflows to download artifacts
  that were created by forked repositories and that are potentially poisoned.
Runbook: |
  1. Consider ensuring that the artifact download job uses the specific run_id for the generated artifact. It is possible specify which run id or commit hash to download the artifact from.
  2. Consider filtering out artifacts created from pull requests.
  3. Consider limiting the possibility for outside collaborators to trigger workflows.
  4. Sanitize cross-fork contents.
