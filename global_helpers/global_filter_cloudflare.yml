Description: >
  This module provides two filters that can apply to all cloudflare detections. 
  The two functions in this module are included in every cloudflare detection, and 
  define if we should include or exclude events. By default, all events are passed
  through the filters. 

  You can change the definition of these filters to work in your own environment. 
  Panther will not change the definition of these, and should not create 
  merge conflicts.
