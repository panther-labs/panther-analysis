version: 0
fields:
  - name: version
    description: The VPC Flow Logs version. If you use the default format, the version is 2. If you specify a custom format, the version is 3.
    type: int
  - name: account
    description: The AWS account ID for the flow log.
    type: string
  - name: interfaceId
    description: The ID of the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.
    type: string
  - name: srcAddr
    description: The source address for incoming traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for outgoing traffic on the network interface. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address.
    type: string
  - name: dstAddr
    description: The destination address for outgoing traffic, or the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the network interface for incoming traffic on the network interface. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address.
    type: string
  - name: srcPort
    description: The source port of the traffic.
    type: int
  - name: dstPort
    description: The destination port of the traffic.
    type: int
  - name: protocol
    description: The IANA protocol number of the traffic.
    type: int
  - name: packets
    description: The number of packets transferred during the flow.
    type: int
  - name: bytes
    description: The number of bytes transferred during the flow.
    type: int
  - name: start
    required: true
    description: The time of the start of the flow (UTC).
    type: timestamp
    timeFormat: rfc3339
  - name: end
    required: true
    description: The time of the end of the flow (UTC).
    type: timestamp
    timeFormat: rfc3339
  - name: action
    description: "The action that is associated with the traffic. ACCEPT: The recorded traffic was permitted by the security groups or network ACLs. REJECT: The recorded traffic was not permitted by the security groups or network ACLs."
    type: string
  - name: status
    required: true
    description: "The logging status of the flow log. OK: Data is logging normally to the chosen destinations. NODATA: There was no network traffic to or from the network interface during the capture window. SKIPDATA: Some flow log records were skipped during the capture window. This may be because of an internal capacity constraint, or an internal error."
    type: string
  - name: vpcId
    description: The ID of the VPC that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.
    type: string
  - name: subNetId
    description: The ID of the subnet that contains the network interface for which the traffic is recorded.
    type: string
  - name: instanceId
    description: The ID of the instance that's associated with network interface for which the traffic is recorded, if the instance is owned by you. Returns a '-' symbol for a requester-managed network interface; for example, the network interface for a NAT gateway.
    type: string
  - name: tcpFlags
    description: "The bitmask value for the following TCP flags: SYN: 2, SYN-ACK: 18, FIN: 1, RST: 4. ACK is reported only when it's accompanied with SYN. TCP flags can be OR-ed during the aggregation interval. For short connections, the flags might be set on the same line in the flow log record, for example, 19 for SYN-ACK and FIN, and 3 for SYN and FIN."
    type: int
  - name: trafficType
    description: "The type of traffic: IPv4, IPv6, or EFA."
    type: string
  - name: pktSrcAddr
    description: The packet-level (original) source IP address of the traffic. Use this field with the srcaddr field to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer through which traffic flows, and the original source IP address of the traffic. For example, when traffic flows through a network interface for a NAT gateway, or where the IP address of a pod in Amazon EKS is different from the IP address of the network interface of the instance node on which the pod is running.
    type: string
  - name: pktDstAddr
    description: The packet-level (original) destination IP address for the traffic. Use this field with the dstaddr field to distinguish between the IP address of an intermediate layer through which traffic flows, and the final destination IP address of the traffic. For example, when traffic flows through a network interface for a NAT gateway, or where the IP address of a pod in Amazon EKS is different from the IP address of the network interface of the instance node on which the pod is running.
    type: string
  - name: pktSrcAwsService
    description: "The name of the subset of IP address ranges for the pkt-srcaddr field, if the source IP address is for an AWS service. The possible values are: AMAZON | AMAZON_APPFLOW | AMAZON_CONNECT | API_GATEWAY | CHIME_MEETINGS | CHIME_VOICECONNECTOR | CLOUD9 | CLOUDFRONT | CODEBUILD | DYNAMODB | EC2 | EC2_INSTANCE_CONNECT | GLOBALACCELERATOR | KINESIS_VIDEO_STREAMS | ROUTE53 | ROUTE53_HEALTHCHECKS | S3 | WORKSPACES_GATEWAYS."
    type: string
  - name: pktDstAwsService
    description: The name of the subset of IP address ranges for the pkt-dstaddr field, if the destination IP address is for an AWS service. For a list of possible values, see the pkt-src-aws-service field.
    type: string
  - name: flowDirection
    description: "The direction of the flow with respect to the interface where traffic is captured. The possible values are: ingress | egress."
    type: string
  - name: trafficPath
    description: The path that egress traffic takes to the destination. To determine whether the traffic is egress traffic, check the flow-direction field. The possible values are as follows. If none of the values apply, the field is set to -. If the network interface is attached to an instance based on the Nitro System, the possible values include 7 and 8 but not 2. With instances not based on the Nitro System (for example, T2 and M4), the possible values include 2 but not 7 or 8. 1 — Through another resource in the same VPC, 2 — Through an internet gateway or a gateway VPC endpoint, 3 — Through a virtual private gateway, 4 — Through an intra-region VPC peering connection, 5 — Through an inter-region VPC peering connection, 6 — Through a local gateway, 7 — Through a gateway VPC endpoint, 8 — Through an internet gateway
