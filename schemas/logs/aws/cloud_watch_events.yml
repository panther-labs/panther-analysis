fields:
  - name: id
    required: true
    description: A unique value is generated for every event. This can be helpful in tracing events as they move through rules to targets, and are processed.

    description: The 12-digit number identifying an AWS account.
    type: string
  - name: source
    required: true
    description: Identifies the service that sourced the event. All events sourced from within AWS begin with 'aws'. Customer-generated events can have any value here, as long as it doesn't begin with 'aws'. We recommend the use of Java package-name style reverse domain-name strings.
    type: string
  - name: resources
    required: true
    description: This JSON array contains ARNs that identify resources that are involved in the event. Inclusion of these ARNs is at the discretion of the service. For example, Amazon EC2 instance state-changes include Amazon EC2 instance ARNs, Auto Scaling events include ARNs for both instances and Auto Scaling groups, but API calls with AWS CloudTrail do not include resource ARNs.
    type: array
    element:
      type: string
  - name: region

    type: string
  - name: version
    required: true
    description: By default, this is set to 0 (zero) in all events.
    type: string
  - name: time
    required: true
    description: The event timestamp, which can be specified by the service originating the event. If the event spans a time interval, the service might choose to report the start time, so this value can be noticeably before the time the event is actually received.
    type: timestamp
    timeFormat: rfc3339
  - name: detail
    required: true
    description: A JSON object, whose content is at the discretion of the service originating the event. The detail content in the example above is very simple, just two fields. AWS API call events have detail objects with around 50 fields nested several levels deep.
