    name: Crowdstrike.ProcessRollup2Stats
description: When a process finishes running, the sensor generates and sends a ProcessRollup2 event. Mac and Linux sensors send far more ProcessRollup2 events than Windows (roughly 20x as many), so rather than send events for every process on those hosts, the sensor sends an initial ProcessRollup2 event, followed 10 minutes later by a ProcessRollup2Stats event with a SHA256 hash and the count of how many times the hash executed in the last 10 minutes.
