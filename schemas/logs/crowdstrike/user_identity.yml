    name: Crowdstrike.UserIdentity
description: The UserIdentity event is generated when a user logs in to a host. It conveys important security-related characteristics associated with a user to the CrowdStrike cloud, such as the user name. It’s normally generated once per security principal, and is thus not on its own a sign of a suspicious activity. Available for Mac & Windows platforms.
