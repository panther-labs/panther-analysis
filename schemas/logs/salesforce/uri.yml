      For example: 3nWgxWbDKWWDIk0FKfF5DV.
  - name: ORGANIZATION_ID
    required: true
    type: string
    description: "The 15-character ID of the organization. For example: 00D000000000123."

    description: "The amount of time that the request took in milliseconds."
  - name: CPU_TIME
    required: false
    type: bigint
    description: >-
      The CPU time in milliseconds used to complete the request.
      This field indicates the amount of activity taking place in the app server layer.
  - name: URI
    required: true
    type: string
    description: >-
      The URI of the page that’s receiving the request. For more granular URI information for Lightning Experience
      and the Salesforce app, see the Lightning Error, Lightning Interaction, Lightning Page View,
      and Lightning Performance event types.
      Examples:
      /aura (Lightning Experience),
      /lightning (Lightning Experience and the Salesforce app),
      /home/home.jsp (Salesforce Classic)
  - name: SESSION_KEY
    required: false
    type: string
    description: >-
      The user’s unique session ID. You can use this value to identify all user events within a session.
      When a user logs out and logs in again, a new session is started. For Login Event Type,
      this field is usually null because the event is captured before a session is created.
      Example d7DEq/ANa7nNZZVD
  - name: LOGIN_KEY
    required: false
    type: string
    description: >-
      The string that ties together all events in a given user’s login session. It starts with a login event and
      ends with either a logout event or the user session expiring. For example: GeJCsym5eyvtEK2I.
  - name: REQUEST_STATUS
    required: false
    type: string
    description: >-
      The status of the request for a page view or user interface action.
      Possible values are:
        S—Success. Salesforce handled the request successfully. If an Apex controller throws an exception, this status is also returned.
        F—Failure. Typically 4xx or 5xx HTTP codes, such as no permission to view page, page took too long to render, page is read-only.
        U—Undefined
        A—Authorization Error
        R—Redirect. Typically a 3xx HTTP code, possibly initiated by an Apex controller in a Visualforce page.
        N—Not Found. 404 error.
  - name: DB_TOTAL_TIME
    required: false
    type: bigint
    description: >-
      The time in nanoseconds for a database round trip. Includes time spent in the JDBC driver,
      network to the database, and DB_CPU_TIME. Compare this field to CPU_TIME to determine whether
      performance issues are occurring in the database layer or in your own code.
  - name: DB_BLOCKS
    required: false
    type: bigint
    description: >-
      Indicates how much activity is occurring in the database.
      A high value for this field suggests that adding indexes or
      filters on your queries would benefit performance.
  - name: DB_CPU_TIME
    required: false
    type: bigint
    description: >-
      The CPU time in milliseconds to complete the request.
      Indicates the amount of activity taking place in the database
