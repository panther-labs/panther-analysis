## GCP

- [Admin Role Assigned](../rules/standard_rules/admin_assigned.yml)
  - Assigning an admin role manually could be a sign of privilege escalation
- [Exec into Pod](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_exec_into_pod.yml)
  - Alerts when users exec into pod. Possible to specify specific projects and allowed users.
- [GCP Access Attempts Violating IAP Access Controls](../rules/gcp_http_lb_rules/gcp_access_attempts_violating_iap_access_controls.yml)
  - GCP Access Attempts Violating IAP Access Controls
- [GCP Access Attempts Violating VPC Service Controls](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_access_attempts_violating_vpc_service_controls.yml)
  - An access attempt violating VPC service controls (such as Perimeter controls) has been made.
- [GCP BigQuery Large Scan](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_bigquery_large_scan.yml)

- [GCP Cloud Armor RCE Attempt Detected](../rules/gcp_http_lb_rules/gcp_cloud_armor_r2s_rce_attempt.yml)
  - Detects when GCP Cloud Armor detects HTTP requests matching specific Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability signatures (google-mrs-v202512-id000001-rce and google-mrs-v202512-id000002-rce) which match React2Shell exploit attempts. These rules indicate active exploitation attempts against known RCE vulnerabilities.
- [GCP Cloud Run Service Created](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloud_run_service_created.yml)
  - Detects creation of new Cloud Run Service, which, if configured maliciously, may be part of the attack aimed to invoke the service and retrieve the access token.
- [GCP Cloud Run Service Created FOLLOWED BY Set IAM Policy](../correlation_rules/gcp_cloud_run_service_create_followed_by_set_iam_policy.yml)
  - Detects run.services.create method for privilege escalation in GCP. The exploit creates a new Cloud Run Service that, when invoked, returns the Service Account's access token by accessing the metadata API of the server it is running on.
- [GCP Cloud Run Set IAM Policy](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloud_run_set_iam_policy.yml)
  - Detects new roles granted to users to Cloud Run Services. This could potentially allow the user to perform actions within the project and its resources, which could pose a security risk.
- [GCP Cloud Storage Buckets Modified Or Deleted](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloud_storage_buckets_modified_or_deleted.yml)
  - Detects when a GCS bucket configuration is updated or deleted. Bucket configuration changes can be part of a ransomware attack, such as disabling security settings to prevent data recovery.
- [GCP CloudBuild Potential Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloudbuild_potential_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - Detects privilege escalation attacks designed to gain access to the Cloud Build Service Account. A user with permissions to start a new build with Cloud Build can gain access to the Cloud Build Service Account and abuse it for more access to the environment.
- [GCP cloudfunctions functions create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloudfunctions_functions_create.yml)
  - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service manages authorization and authentication for a GCP environment. This means that there are very likely multiple privilege escalation methods that use the IAM service and/or its permissions.
- [GCP cloudfunctions functions update](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_cloudfunctions_functions_update.yml)
  - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service manages authorization and authentication for a GCP environment. This means that there are very likely multiple privilege escalation methods that use the IAM service and/or its permissions.
- [GCP Compute IAM Policy Update Detection](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_compute_set_iam_policy.yml)
  - This rule detects updates to IAM policies for Compute Disks, Images, and Snapshots.
- [GCP Compute SSH Connection](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_compute_ssh_connection.yml)
  - Detect any SSH connections to a Compute Instance.
- [GCP compute.instances.create Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_computeinstances_create_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - Detects compute.instances.create method for privilege escalation in GCP. This rule identifies when users create compute instances with service accounts that may lead to privilege escalation. Known good service accounts (GKE, Kubernetes, compute automation) are excluded to reduce false positives.
- [GCP Corporate Email Not Used](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_corp_email.yml)
  - Unexpected domain is being used instead of a corporate email
- [GCP Destructive Queries](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_destructive_queries.yml)

- [GCP DNS Zone Modified or Deleted](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_dns_zone_modified_or_deleted.yml)
  - Detection for GCP DNS zones that are deleted, patched, or updated.
- [GCP External User Ownership Invite](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_invite_external_user_as_owner.yml)
  - This rule detects when an external user is invited as an owner of a GCP project using the InsertProjectOwnershipInvite event.
- [GCP Firewall Rule Created](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_firewall_rule_created.yml)
  - This rule detects creations of GCP firewall rules.
- [GCP Firewall Rule Deleted](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_firewall_rule_deleted.yml)
  - This rule detects deletions of GCP firewall rules.
- [GCP Firewall Rule Modified](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_firewall_rule_modified.yml)
  - This rule detects modifications to GCP firewall rules.
- [GCP GCS Bulk Object Deletion](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_bulk_deletion.yml)
  - Detects bulk deletion of GCS objects. This pattern is indicative of a ransomware attack or data destruction where an adversary deletes storage objects at scale. The threshold of 10+ deletion operations suggests automated bulk deletion rather than normal application behavior. This can be part of a double extortion ransomware attack where data is both encrypted and deleted to increase pressure on victims.
- [GCP GCS Bulk Object Rewrite Operation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_object_rewrite.yml)
  - Detects GCS object rewrite operations which may indicate ransomware operations attempting to rewrite data in the same bucket with an attacker-controlled encryption key. Attackers with compromised credentials can use gsutil rewrite commands to replace existing encryption keys on cloud storage objects, effectively encrypting data for ransom. This detection focuses on identifying suspicious re-encryption activity through the 'gsutil rewrite -k' command patterns in user agent strings, with a threshold of 10 events.
- [GCP GCS IAM Permission Changes](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_iam_changes.yml)
  - Monitoring changes to Cloud Storage bucket permissions may reduce time to detect and correct permissions on sensitive Cloud Storage bucket and objects inside the bucket.
- [GCP GCS Object Copied to Different Bucket](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_object_exfiltration.yml)
  - Detects when GCS objects are copied from one bucket to another bucket. This pattern can indicate data exfiltration where an adversary copies sensitive data to a bucket they control. The threshold of 10+ copy operations suggests bulk exfiltration rather than normal operations. This is detected by monitoring storage.objects.get operations that include a destination field in the metadata, indicating a copy operation.
- [GCP GCS Ransom Note Upload](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_ransom_note_upload.yml)
  - Detects when a file with a name matching common ransomware note patterns is uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Ransomware attackers often leave ransom notes with distinctive filenames to provide victims with payment instructions.
- [GCP GKE Kubernetes Cron Job Created Or Modified](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_cron_job_created_or_modified.yml)
  - This detection monitor for any modifications or creations of a cron job in GKE. Attackers may create or modify an existing scheduled job in order to achieve cluster persistence.
- [GCP IAM and Tag Enumeration](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_tag_enumeration.yml)
  - Detects enumeration of IAM policies and tags in GCP, which could be a precursor to privilege escalation attempts via tag-based access control.
- [GCP IAM Role Has Changed](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_custom_role_changes.yml)
  - A custom role has been created, deleted, or updated.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts getAccessToken Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_service_accounts_get_access_token_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service manages authorization and authentication for a GCP environment. This means that there are very likely multiple privilege escalation methods that use the IAM service and/or its permissions.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts signBlob](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_service_accounts_sign_blob.yml)
  - The iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob permission "allows signing of arbitrary payloads" in GCP. This means we can create a signed blob that requests an access token from the Service Account we are targeting.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts.signJwt Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_serviceaccounts_signjwt.yml)
  - Detects iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt method for privilege escalation in GCP. This method works by signing well-formed JSON web tokens (JWTs). The script for this method will sign a well-formed JWT and request a new access token belonging to the Service Account with it.
- [GCP iam.roles.update Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_roles_update_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you to update the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you, you will gain the additional privileges, which could be anything you desire.
- [GCP Inbound SSO Profile Created](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_inbound_sso_profile_created_or_updated.yml)
- [GCP K8s IOCActivity](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_ioc_activity.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any kubernetes API Request originating from an Indicator of Compromise.
- [GCP K8s New Daemonset Deployed](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_new_daemonset_deployed.yml)
  - Detects Daemonset creation in GCP Kubernetes clusters.
- [GCP K8s Pod Attached To Node Host Network](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_attached_to_node_host_network.yml)
  - This detection monitor for the creation of pods which are attached to the host's network. This allows a pod to listen to all network traffic for all deployed computer on that particular node and communicate with other compute on the network namespace. Attackers can use this to capture secrets passed in arguments or connections.
- [GCP K8S Pod Create Or Modify Host Path Volume Mount](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_create_or_modify_host_path_vol_mount.yml)
  - This detection monitors for pod creation with a hostPath volume mount. The attachment to a node's volume can allow for privilege escalation through underlying vulnerabilities or it can open up possibilities for data exfiltration or unauthorized file access. It is very rare to see this being a pod requirement. System service accounts in the kube-system namespace are excluded to prevent false positives from legitimate system components.
- [GCP K8s Pod Using Host PID Namespace](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_using_host_pid_namespace.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host PID namespace. The Host PID namespace enables a pod and its containers to have direct access and share the same view as of the host’s processes. This can offer a powerful escape hatch to the underlying host.
- [GCP K8S Privileged Pod Created](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_privileged_pod_created.yml)
  - Alerts when a user creates privileged pod. These particular pods have full access to the host’s namespace and devices, have the ability to exploit the kernel, have dangerous linux capabilities, and can be a powerful launching point for further attacks. In the event of a successful container escape where a user is operating with root privileges, the attacker retains this role on the node.
- [GCP K8S Service Type NodePort Deployed](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_service_type_node_port_deployed.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any kubernetes service deployed with type node port. A Node Port service allows an attacker to expose a set of pods hosting the service to the internet by opening their port and redirecting traffic here. This can be used to bypass network controls and intercept traffic, creating a direct line to the outside network.
- [GCP KMS Bulk Encryption by GCS Service Account](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_kms_bulk_encryption.yml)
  - Detects bulk KMS encryption operations performed by the GCS service account. This pattern is indicative of a ransomware attack where an adversary directly calls the KMS Encrypt API using the GCS service account identity to encrypt data at scale, effectively holding data hostage. The threshold of 10+ encryption operations suggests automated bulk encryption rather than normal application behavior.
- [GCP KMS Cross-Project Encryption](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_kms_cross_project_encryption.yml)
  - Detects when a GCS service account in one project uses a KMS encryption key from a different project. This could indicate potential ransomware activity where an attacker is using their own KMS key to encrypt data in a victim's project, making it inaccessible without the attacker's key.
- [GCP KMS Key Granted to GCS Service Account](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_kms_enable_key.yml)
  - Detects when a KMS IAM policy grants encryption/decryption permissions to a GCS service account. This pattern may indicate a ransomware attack where an adversary grants a GCS service account access to KMS keys to enable encryption of cloud storage objects.
- [GCP KMS Key Version Disabled or Destroyed](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_kms_erase_key.yml)
  - Detects when a KMS key version is disabled, scheduled for destruction, or destroyed. Disabling or destroying KMS key versions can be used to deny access to encrypted data—a ransomware tactic where attackers disable keys to prevent victims from accessing their data.
- [GCP Log Bucket or Sink Deleted](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_log_bucket_or_sink_deleted.yml)
  - This rule detects deletions of GCP Log Buckets or Sinks.
- [GCP Logging Settings Modified](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_logging_settings_modified.yml)

- [GCP Logging Sink Modified](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_logging_sink_modified.yml)
  - This rule detects modifications to GCP Log Sinks.
- [GCP Org or Folder Policy Was Changed Manually](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_org_folder_changes.yml)
  - Alert if a GCP Org or Folder Policy Was Changed Manually.
- [GCP Permissions Granted to Create or Manage Service Account Key](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_permissions_granted_to_create_or_manage_service_account_key.yml)
  - Permissions granted to impersonate a service account. This includes predefined service account IAM roles granted at the parent project, folder or organization-level.
- [GCP Privilege Escalation via TagBinding](../correlation_rules/gcp_tag_escalation.yml)
  - Detects a sequence of events that could indicate a privilege escalation attempt via GCP's tag-based access control. The sequence includes: 1. Enumeration of IAM policies and tags 2. Creation of a tag binding 3. Performance of a privileged operation
- [GCP Privileged Operation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_privileged_operation.yml)
  - Detects privileged operations in GCP that could be part of a privilege escalation attempt, especially when following tag binding creation.
- [GCP Resource in Unused Region](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_unused_regions.yml)
  - Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.
- [GCP Service Account Access Denied](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_service_account_access_denied.yml)
  - This rule detects deletions of GCP Log Buckets or Sinks.
- [GCP Service Account or Keys Created ](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_service_account_or_keys_created.yml)
  - Detects when a service account or key is created manually by a user instead of an automated workflow.
- [GCP serviceusage.apiKeys.create Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_serviceusage_apikeys_create_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - Detects serviceusage.apiKeys.create method for privilege escalation in GCP. By default, API Keys are created with no restrictions, which means they have access to the entire GCP project they were created in. We can capitalize on that fact by creating a new API key that may have more privileges than our own user.
- [GCP Snapshot Creation Detection](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_snapshot_insert.yml)
  - This rule detects when someone with an unexpected email domain creates a snapshot of a Compute Disk.
- [GCP SQL Config Changes](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_sql_config_changes.yml)
  - Monitoring changes to Sql Instance configuration may reduce time to detect and correct misconfigurations done on sql server.
- [GCP storage hmac keys create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_storage_hmac_keys_create.yml)
  - There is a feature of Cloud Storage, “interoperability”, that provides a way for Cloud Storage to interact with storage offerings from other cloud providers, like AWS S3. As part of that, there are HMAC keys that can be created for both Service Accounts and regular users. We can escalate Cloud Storage permissions by creating an HMAC key for a higher-privileged Service Account.
- [GCP Tag Binding Creation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_tag_binding_creation.yml)
  - Detects the creation of tag bindings in GCP, which could be part of a privilege escalation attempt using tag-based access control.
- [GCP User Added to IAP Protected Service](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_user_added_to_iap_protected_service.yml)
  - A user has been granted access to a IAP protected service.
- [GCP User Added to Privileged Group](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_user_added_to_privileged_group.yml)

- [GCP VPC Flow Logs Disabled](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_vpc_flow_logs_disabled.yml)
  - VPC flow logs were disabled for a subnet.
- [GCP Workforce Pool Created or Updated](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_workforce_pool_created_or_updated.yml)
- [GCP Workload Identity Pool Created or Updated](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_workload_identity_pool_created_or_updated.yml)
- [GCP.Iam.ServiceAccountKeys.Create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_service_account_key_create.yml)
  - If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you to update the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you, you will gain the additional privileges, which could be anything you desire.
- [GCP.Privilege.Escalation.By.Deployments.Create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_privilege_escalation_by_deployments_create.yml)
  - Detects privilege escalation in GCP by taking over the deploymentsmanager.deployments.create permission
- [GCS Bucket Made Public](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_public.yml)
