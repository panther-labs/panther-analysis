- [EKS Audit Log based single sourceIP is generating multiple 403s](../rules/aws_eks_rules/source_ip_multiple_403.yml)
  - This detection identifies if a public sourceIP is generating multiple 403s with the Kubernetes API server.
- [EKS Audit Log Reporting system Namespace is Used From A Public IP](../rules/aws_eks_rules/system_namespace_public_ip.yml)
  - This detection identifies if an activity is recorded in the Kubernetes audit log where the user:username attribute begins with "system:" or "eks:" and the requests originating IP Address is a Public IP Address
- [IOC Activity in K8 Control Plane](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_ioc_activity.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any kubernetes API Request originating from an Indicator of Compromise.
- [Kubernetes Cron Job Created or Modified](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_cron_job_created_or_modified.yml)
  - This detection monitor for any modifications or creations of a cron job. Attackers may create or modify an existing scheduled job in order to achieve cluster persistence.
- [Kubernetes Pod Created in Pre-Configured or Default Name Spaces](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_in_default_name_space_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod created in pre-configured or default namespaces. Only Cluster Admins should be creating pods in the kube-system namespace, and it is best practice not to run any cluster critical infrastructure here. The kube-public namespace is intended to be readable by unauthenticated users. The default namespace is shipped with the cluster and it is best practice not to deploy production workloads here. These namespaces may be used to evade defenses or hide attacker infrastructure.
- [New Admission Controller Created](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_admission_controller_created_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a new admission controller being created in the cluster. Admission controllers allows an attack to intercept all API requests made within a cluster, allowing for enumeration of resources and common actions. This can be a very powerful tool to understand where to pivot to next.
- [New DaemonSet Deployed to Kubernetes](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_new_daemonset_deployed.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a new DaemonSet deployed to a kubernetes cluster. A daemonset is a workload that guarantees the presence of exactly one instance of a specific pod on every node in the cluster. This can be a very powerful tool for establishing peristence.
- [Pod attached to the Node Host Network](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_attached_to_node_host_network.yml)
  - This detection monitor for the creation of pods which are attached to the host's network.

Attackers can use this to capture secrets passed in arguments or connections.
- [Pod Created or Modified Using the Host IPC Namespace](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_using_host_ipc_namespace_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host IPC Namespace. Deploying pods in the Host IPC Namespace, breaks isolation between the pod and the underlying host meaning the pod has direct access to the same IPC objects and communications channels as the host system.
- [Pod Created or Modified Using the Host PID Namespace](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_using_host_pid_namespace_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host PID namespace. The Host PID namespace enables a pod and its containers to have direct access and share the same view as of the host’s processes. This can offer a powerful escape hatch to the underlying host.
- [Pod Created with Overly Permissive Linux Capabilities](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_overly_permissive_linux_capabilities.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a pod created with overly permissive linux capabilities. Excessive pod permissions and capabilities can be a launch point for privilege escalation or container breakout.
- [Pod creation or modification to a Host Path Volume Mount](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_create_or_modify_host_path_vol_mount.yml)
  - This detection monitors for pod creation with a hostPath volume mount. The attachment to a node's volume can allow for privilege escalation through underlying vulnerabilities or it can open up possibilities for data exfiltration or unauthorized file access. It is very rare to see this being a pod requirement.
- [Privileged Pod Created](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_privileged_pod_created.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a privileged pod is created either by default or with permissions to run as root. These particular pods have full access to the hosts namespace and devices, ability to exploit the kernel, have dangerous linux capabilities, and can be a powerful launching point for further attacks.
- [Secret Enumeration by a User](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_secret_enumeration.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a large number of secrets requests by a single user. This could potentially indicate secret enumeration, which can potentially enable lateral or vertical movement and unauthorized access to critical resources.
- [Unauthenticated Kubernetes API Request](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_unauthenticated_api_request.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any unauthenticated kubernetes api request. Unauthenticated Requests are performed by the anonymous user and have unfederated access to the cluster.
- [Unauthorized Kubernetes Pod Execution](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_unauthorized_pod_execution_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod execution in a kubernetes cluster. Pod execution should never be done in a production cluster, and can indicate a user performing unauthorized actions.

  - This detects the usage of highly permissive IAM Policies that should only be assigned to a small number of users, roles, or groups.
- [AWS IAM Policy Does Not Grant Any Administrative Access](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_policy_does_not_grant_admin_access.yml)
  - This policy validates that no IAM policies grant admin access. This should be combined with suppressions on the legitimate IAM admin policies in your account so that it only fires when new and unexpected policies granting admin access are created.
- [AWS IAM Policy Does Not Grant Network Admin Access](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_policy_does_not_grant_network_admin_access.yml)
  - This policy validates that no IAM policies grant admin privileges on network resources. This should be used in conjunction with suppressions for the legitimate network admin policies in your account.

- [AWS IAM Role Grants (permission) to Non-organizational Account](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_external_permission.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM roles that grant the (specified) permission do not allow accounts outside the organization to assume them.
- [AWS IAM Role Restricts Usage](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_restricts_usage.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM roles in the account are restrictive in what entities may assume them. This can help prevent malicious actors from assuming roles they should not be assuming.
- [AWS IAM Role Trust Relationship for GitHub Actions](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_github_actions_trust.yml)
  - This policy ensures that IAM roles used with GitHub Actions are securely configured to prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources.  It validates trust relationships by checking for proper audience (aud) restrictions, ensuring it is set to sts.amazonaws.com, and subject (sub) conditions,  confirming they are scoped to specific repositories or environments. Misconfigurations, such as overly permissive wildcards or missing conditions,  can allow unauthorized repositories to assume roles, leading to potential data breaches or compliance violations.  By enforcing these checks, the policy mitigates risks of exploitation, enhances security posture, and protects critical AWS resources from external threats.
- [AWS IAM User MFA ](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_user_mfa.yml)
  - This policy validates that all AWS IAM users with access to the AWS Console have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled.
- [AWS IAM User Not In Conflicting Groups](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_user_not_in_conflicting_groups.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM users are not in IAM groups that are considered mutually exclusive. For example, in some workflows developers are responsible for dev environments and sysadmins are responsible for prod environments. In this situation no (or very few) users should be in both sysadmin and developer groups. This is in following with the principle of least privilege.
- [AWS Resource Minimum Tags ](../policies/aws_account_policies/aws_resource_minimum_tags.yml)
  - This policy ensures that applicable resources have a minimum number of tags set.
- [AWS Resource Required Tags](../policies/aws_account_policies/aws_resource_required_tags.yml)

  - Alerts if outbound DNS traffic is detected to a non-approved DNS server. DNS is often used as a means to exfiltrate data or perform command and control for compromised hosts. All DNS traffic should be routed through internal DNS servers or trusted 3rd parties.
- [VPC Flow Port Scanning](../queries/aws_queries/anomalous_vpc_port_activity.yml)
  - Searches for potential port scanning activity in VPC Flow logs
- [Wiz Issue Followed By SSH to EC2 Instance](../correlation_rules/wiz_issue_followed_by_ssh.yml)
  - Wiz detected a security issue with an EC2 instance followed by an SSH connection to the instance. This sequence could indicate a potential security breach.


## AWS WAF

- [AWS WAF Has XSS Predicate](../policies/aws_waf_policies/aws_waf_has_xss_predicate.yml)
  - This policy validates that all WAF's have at least one rule with a predicate matching on and blocking XSS attacks.
- [AWS WAF Logging Configured](../policies/aws_waf_policies/aws_waf_logging_configured.yml)
  - Ensures that AWS WAF logging is enabled and that the logs are being sent to a valid destination (S3, CloudWatch, or Kinesis Firehose). Without logging, visibility into WAF activity is severely limited, increasing the risk of undetected attacks.
- [AWS WAF Rule Ordering](../policies/aws_waf_policies/aws_waf_rule_ordering.yml)
  - This policy validates that all WAF's have the correct rule ordering. Incorrect rule ordering could lead to less restrictive rules being matched and allowing traffic through before more restrictive rules that should have blocked the traffic.
- [AWS WAF WebACL Has Associated Resources](../policies/aws_waf_policies/aws_waf_webacl_has_associated_resources.yml)
  - This policy ensures that AWS WAF WebACLs are associated with at least one resource (ALB, CloudFront Distribution, or API Gateway). If a WebACL is not associated with any resources, it is inactive and not providing any protection.
