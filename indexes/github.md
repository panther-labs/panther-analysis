## GitHub

- [Admin Role Assigned](../rules/standard_rules/admin_assigned.yml)
  - Assigning an admin role manually could be a sign of privilege escalation
- [GitHub Action Failed](../rules/github_rules/github_action_failed.yml)
  - A monitored github action has failed.
- [GitHub Advanced Security Change WITHOUT Repo Archived](../correlation_rules/github_advanced_security_change_not_followed_by_repo_archived.yml)
  - Identifies when advances security change was made not to archive a repo. Eliminates false positives in the Advances Security Change Rule when the repo is archived.
- [GitHub Branch Protection Disabled](../rules/github_rules/github_branch_protection_disabled.yml)
  - Disabling branch protection controls could indicate malicious use of admin credentials in an attempt to hide activity.
- [GitHub Branch Protection Policy Override](../rules/github_rules/github_branch_policy_override.yml)
  - Bypassing branch protection controls could indicate malicious use of admin credentials in an attempt to hide activity.
- [GitHub Commits Skipping Workflows](../rules/github_rules/github_workflow_skip_commits.yml)
  - Detects commits from cross-fork scenarios that contain workflow skip directives, which bypass GitHub Actions workflows. These skip patterns ([skip ci], [ci skip], [no ci], [skip actions], [actions skip], skip-checks:true) can be used to avoid security checks and CI/CD processes. This rule only alerts on commits to public forkable repositories.
- [GitHub Dependabot Vulnerability Dismissed](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_vulnerability_dismissed.yml)
  - Creates an alert if a dependabot alert is dismissed without being fixed.
- [GitHub Malicious Pull Request Titles](../rules/github_rules/github_malicious_pr_titles.yml)
  - Detects malicious patterns in GitHub pull request titles, descriptions, and commit messages that could indicate bash injection attempts or other malicious activity. This rule is designed to catch attacks like the Nx vulnerability (GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598c) where PR titles contained bash injection payloads that could be executed by vulnerable CI workflows. Lower severity  for PRs that are not cross-fork.
- [GitHub Org Authentication Method Changed](../rules/github_rules/github_org_auth_modified.yml)
  - Detects changes to GitHub org authentication changes.
- [GitHub Org IP Allow List modified](../rules/github_rules/github_org_ip_allowlist.yml)
  - Detects changes to a GitHub Org IP Allow List
- [Github Organization App Integration Installed](../rules/github_rules/github_organization_app_integration_installed.yml)
  - An application integration was installed to your organization's Github account by someone in your organization.
- [Github Public Repository Created](../rules/github_rules/github_public_repository_created.yml)
  - A public Github repository was created.
- [GitHub pull_request_target Workflow Usage](../rules/github_rules/github_pull_request_target_usage.yml)
  - Detects usage of pull_request_target workflows, which run with elevated privileges and can access secrets even when triggered by external contributors from forks. These workflows pose security risks as they run in the context of the target repository rather than the fork, potentially allowing malicious code execution with write access and secrets. Low severity for non-cross-fork PRs.
- [GitHub pull_request_target Workflow with Checkout Action](../correlation_rules/github_pull_request_target_with_checkout_in_workflow.yml)
  - Detects when a pull_request_target workflow contains a checkout action, creating a potential security risk. pull_request_target workflows run with elevated privileges and have access to repository secrets even when triggered by external contributors from forks. When combined with a checkout action, this can create dangerous scenarios. The severity depends on what is checked out: CRITICAL if checking out PR head (ref: github.event.pull_request.head.sha) as untrusted code runs with secrets; HIGH if checking out base branch but workflow uses untrusted PR context data (title, body, labels, etc.); MEDIUM if only checking out base branch with no PR context usage. This is a well-known attack vector for supply chain compromise in GitHub Actions, often called a "pwn request".
- [GitHub Repository Archived](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_archived.yml)
  - Detects when a repository is archived.
- [GitHub Repository Collaborator Change](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_collaborator_change.yml)
  - Detects when a repository collaborator is added or removed.
- [GitHub Repository Created](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_created.yml)
  - Detects when a repository is created.
- [GitHub Repository Ruleset Modified](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_ruleset_modified.yml)
  - Disabling repository ruleset controls could indicate malicious use of admin credentials in an attempt to hide activity.
- [Github Repository Transfer](../rules/github_rules/github_repository_transfer.yml)
  - A user accepted a request to receive a transferred Github repository, a  Github repository was transferred to another repository network, or a user sent a request to transfer a repository to another user or organization.
- [GitHub Repository Visibility Change](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_visibility_change.yml)
  - Detects when an organization repository visibility changes.
- [GitHub Secret Scanning Alert Created](../rules/github_rules/github_secret_scanning_alert_created.yml)
  - GitHub detected a secret and created a secret scanning alert.
- [GitHub Security Change, includes GitHub Advanced Security](../rules/github_rules/github_advanced_security_change.yml)
  - The rule alerts when GitHub Security tools (Dependabot, Secret Scanner, etc) are disabled.
- [GitHub Supply Chain - Software Installation Tool User Agents](../rules/github_rules/github_supply_chain_suspicious_user_agents.yml)
  - Detects software installation tool user agents in GitHub audit logs that should never  directly access GitHub. Package managers like npm, pip, yarn, and system installers  operate at the registry level, not GitHub audit level. Their presence indicates: 1. Supply chain attacks using spoofed user agents to blend in 2. Compromised systems running installation tools with stolen GitHub tokens   3. Malicious automation disguised as legitimate package managersBased on analysis of GitHub audit logs showing zero legitimate npm/yarn/pip user agents, any such patterns are inherently suspicious and warrant immediate investigation.
- [GitHub Team Modified](../rules/github_rules/github_team_modified.yml)
  - Detects when a team is modified in some way, such as adding a new team, deleting a team, modifying members, or a change in repository control.
- [GitHub User Access Key Created](../rules/github_rules/github_user_access_key_created.yml)
  - Detects when a GitHub user access key is created.
- [GitHub User Added or Removed from Org](../rules/github_rules/github_org_modified.yml)
  - Detects when a user is added or removed from a GitHub Org.
- [GitHub User Added to Org Moderators](../rules/github_rules/github_org_moderators_add.yml)
  - Detects when a user is added to a GitHub org's list of moderators.
- [GitHub User Initial Access to Private Repo](../rules/github_rules/github_repo_initial_access.yml)
  - Detects when a user initially accesses a private organization repository.
- [GitHub User Role Updated](../rules/github_rules/github_user_role_updated.yml)
  - Detects when a GitHub user role is upgraded to an admin or downgraded to a member
- [GitHub Web Hook Modified](../rules/github_rules/github_webhook_modified.yml)
  - Detects when a webhook is added, modified, or deleted
- [GitHub Workflow Contains Checkout Action](../rules/github_rules/github_workflow_contains_checkout.yml)
  - Detects when a GitHub Actions workflow job contains a checkout step. The checkout action (actions/checkout) pulls repository code into the workflow runner. In certain contexts, especially with pull_request_target triggers or workflows with elevated permissions, checking out untrusted code can pose security risks. This detection helps identify workflows that interact with repository code for security review.
- [MFA Disabled](../rules/standard_rules/mfa_disabled.yml)
  - Detects when Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is disabled
- [NX Supply Chain - S1ngularity Repository Detection](../queries/github_queries/nx_supply_chain_s1ngularity_repository_query.yml)
  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/security/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598cDetects GitHub activity associated with the NX supply chain compromise (CVE-2024-XXXX).The s1ngularity attack compromised popular NX build system packages affecting ~4M weekly downloads.Attack Details:- Malicious NPM packages published August 26-27, 2025 (22:32-03:37 UTC)- Created repositories: "s1ngularity-repository", "s1ngularity-repository-0/1" for data exfiltration- Targeted cryptocurrency wallets, SSH keys, GitHub/NPM tokens, .env files- Used triple base64 encoding to upload stolen credentials- First documented case of weaponizing AI CLI tools for reconnaissanceThis query detects repository creation, access, and API activity patterns consistent with the attack.
- [Secret Exposed and not Quarantined](../correlation_rules/secret_exposed_and_not_quarantined.yml)
  - The rule detects when a GitHub Secret Scan detects an exposed secret, which is not followed by the expected quarantine operation in AWS.  When you make a repository public, or push changes to a public repository, GitHub always scans the code for secrets that match partner patterns. Public packages on the npm registry are also scanned. If secret scanning detects a potential secret, we notify the service provider who issued the secret. The service provider validates the string and then decides whether they should revoke the secret, issue a new secret, or contact you directly. Their action will depend on the associated risks to you or them.
