- [NX Supply Chain - S1ngularity Repository Detection](../queries/github_queries/nx_supply_chain_s1ngularity_repository_query.yml)
  - https://github.com/nrwl/nx/security/advisories/GHSA-cxm3-wv7p-598cDetects GitHub activity associated with the NX supply chain compromise (CVE-2024-XXXX).The s1ngularity attack compromised popular NX build system packages affecting ~4M weekly downloads.Attack Details:- Malicious NPM packages published August 26-27, 2025 (22:32-03:37 UTC)- Created repositories: "s1ngularity-repository", "s1ngularity-repository-0/1" for data exfiltration- Targeted cryptocurrency wallets, SSH keys, GitHub/NPM tokens, .env files- Used triple base64 encoding to upload stolen credentials- First documented case of weaponizing AI CLI tools for reconnaissanceThis query detects repository creation, access, and API activity patterns consistent with the attack.
- [Secret Exposed and not Quarantined](../correlation_rules/secret_exposed_and_not_quarantined.yml)
  - The rule detects when a GitHub Secret Scan detects an exposed secret, which is not followed by the expected quarantine operation in AWS.  When you make a repository public, or push changes to a public repository, GitHub always scans the code for secrets that match partner patterns. Public packages on the npm registry are also scanned. If secret scanning detects a potential secret, we notify the service provider who issued the secret. The service provider validates the string and then decides whether they should revoke the secret, issue a new secret, or contact you directly. Their action will depend on the associated risks to you or them.
