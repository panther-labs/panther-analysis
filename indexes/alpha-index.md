- [EKS Audit Log based single sourceIP is generating multiple 403s](../rules/aws_eks_rules/source_ip_multiple_403.yml)
  - This detection identifies if a public sourceIP is generating multiple 403s with the Kubernetes API server.
- [EKS Audit Log Reporting system Namespace is Used From A Public IP](../rules/aws_eks_rules/system_namespace_public_ip.yml)
  - This detection identifies if an activity is recorded in the Kubernetes audit log where the user:username attribute begins with "system:" or "eks:" and the requests originating IP Address is a Public IP Address
- [IOC Activity in K8 Control Plane](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_ioc_activity.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any kubernetes API Request originating from an Indicator of Compromise.
- [Kubernetes Cron Job Created or Modified](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_cron_job_created_or_modified.yml)

- [Kubernetes Pod Created in Pre-Configured or Default Name Spaces](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_in_default_name_space_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod created in pre-configured or default namespaces. Only Cluster Admins should be creating pods in the kube-system namespace, and it is best practice not to run any cluster critical infrastructure here. The kube-public namespace is intended to be readable by unauthenticated users. The default namespace is shipped with the cluster and it is best practice not to deploy production workloads here. These namespaces may be used to evade defenses or hide attacker infrastructure.
- [New Admission Controller Created](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_admission_controller_created_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a new admission controller being created in the cluster. Admission controllers allows an attack to intercept all API requests made within a cluster, allowing for enumeration of resources and common actions. This can be a very powerful tool to understand where to pivot to next.
- [New DaemonSet Deployed to Kubernetes](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_new_daemonset_deployed.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a new DaemonSet deployed to a kubernetes cluster. A daemonset is a workload that guarantees the presence of exactly one instance of a specific pod on every node in the cluster. This can be a very powerful tool for establishing peristence.
- [Pod attached to the Node Host Network](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_attached_to_node_host_network.yml)
  - This detection monitor for the creation of pods which are attached to the host's network.

Attackers can use this to capture secrets passed in arguments or connections.
- [Pod Created or Modified Using the Host IPC Namespace](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_using_host_ipc_namespace_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host IPC Namespace. Deploying pods in the Host IPC Namespace, breaks isolation between the pod and the underlying host meaning the pod has direct access to the same IPC objects and communications channels as the host system.
- [Pod Created or Modified Using the Host PID Namespace](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_using_host_pid_namespace_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host PID namespace. The Host PID namespace enables a pod and its containers to have direct access and share the same view as of the host’s processes. This can offer a powerful escape hatch to the underlying host.
- [Pod Created with Overly Permissive Linux Capabilities](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_overly_permissive_linux_capabilities.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a pod created with overly permissive linux capabilities. Excessive pod permissions and capabilities can be a launch point for privilege escalation or container breakout.
- [Pod creation or modification to a Host Path Volume Mount](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_pod_create_or_modify_host_path_vol_mount.yml)
  - This detection monitors for pod creation with a hostPath volume mount. The attachment to a node's volume can allow for privilege escalation through underlying vulnerabilities or it can open up possibilities for data exfiltration or unauthorized file access. It is very rare to see this being a pod requirement.
- [Privileged Pod Created](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_privileged_pod_created.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a privileged pod is created either by default or with permissions to run as root. These particular pods have full access to the hosts namespace and devices, ability to exploit the kernel, have dangerous linux capabilities, and can be a powerful launching point for further attacks.
- [Secret Enumeration by a User](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_secret_enumeration.yml)
  - This detection monitors for a large number of secrets requests by a single user. This could potentially indicate secret enumeration, which can potentially enable lateral or vertical movement and unauthorized access to critical resources.
- [Unauthenticated Kubernetes API Request](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_unauthenticated_api_request.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any unauthenticated kubernetes api request. Unauthenticated Requests are performed by the anonymous user and have unfederated access to the cluster.
- [Unauthorized Kubernetes Pod Execution](../queries/kubernetes_queries/kubernetes_unauthorized_pod_execution_query.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod execution in a kubernetes cluster. Pod execution should never be done in a production cluster, and can indicate a user performing unauthorized actions.

  - This detects the usage of highly permissive IAM Policies that should only be assigned to a small number of users, roles, or groups.
- [AWS IAM Policy Does Not Grant Any Administrative Access](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_policy_does_not_grant_admin_access.yml)
  - This policy validates that no IAM policies grant admin access. This should be combined with suppressions on the legitimate IAM admin policies in your account so that it only fires when new and unexpected policies granting admin access are created.
- [AWS IAM Policy Does Not Grant Network Admin Access](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_policy_does_not_grant_network_admin_access.yml)
  - This policy validates that no IAM policies grant admin privileges on network resources. This should be used in conjunction with suppressions for the legitimate network admin policies in your account.
- [AWS IAM Policy Role Mapping](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_policy_role_mapping.yml)
  - This policy validates that policies that have been explicitly configured to be set to certain roles are still attached to those roles.
- [AWS IAM Resource Does Not Have Inline Policy](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_resource_does_not_have_inline_policy.yml)

- [AWS IAM Role Grants (permission) to Non-organizational Account](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_external_permission.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM roles that grant the (specified) permission do not allow accounts outside the organization to assume them.
- [AWS IAM Role Restricts Usage](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_restricts_usage.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM roles in the account are restrictive in what entities may assume them. This can help prevent malicious actors from assuming roles they should not be assuming.
- [AWS IAM Role Trust Relationship for GitHub Actions](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_role_github_actions_trust.yml)
  - This policy ensures that IAM roles used with GitHub Actions are securely configured to prevent unauthorized access to AWS resources.  It validates trust relationships by checking for proper audience (aud) restrictions, ensuring it is set to sts.amazonaws.com, and subject (sub) conditions,  confirming they are scoped to specific repositories or environments. Misconfigurations, such as overly permissive wildcards or missing conditions,  can allow unauthorized repositories to assume roles, leading to potential data breaches or compliance violations.  By enforcing these checks, the policy mitigates risks of exploitation, enhances security posture, and protects critical AWS resources from external threats.
- [AWS IAM User MFA ](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_user_mfa.yml)
  - This policy validates that all AWS IAM users with access to the AWS Console have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled.
- [AWS IAM User Not In Conflicting Groups](../policies/aws_iam_policies/aws_iam_user_not_in_conflicting_groups.yml)
  - This policy validates that IAM users are not in IAM groups that are considered mutually exclusive. For example, in some workflows developers are responsible for dev environments and sysadmins are responsible for prod environments. In this situation no (or very few) users should be in both sysadmin and developer groups. This is in following with the principle of least privilege.
- [AWS Resource Minimum Tags ](../policies/aws_account_policies/aws_resource_minimum_tags.yml)
  - This policy ensures that applicable resources have a minimum number of tags set.
- [AWS Resource Required Tags](../policies/aws_account_policies/aws_resource_required_tags.yml)

  - This detection monitor for any modifications or creations of a cron job in GKE. Attackers may create or modify an existing scheduled job in order to achieve cluster persistence.
- [GCP IAM Role Has Changed](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_custom_role_changes.yml)
  - A custom role has been created, deleted, or updated.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts getAccessToken Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_service_accounts_get_access_token_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service manages authorization and authentication for a GCP environment. This means that there are very likely multiple privilege escalation methods that use the IAM service and/or its permissions.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts signBlob](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_service_accounts_sign_blob.yml)
  - The iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob permission "allows signing of arbitrary payloads" in GCP. This means we can create a signed blob that requests an access token from the Service Account we are targeting.
- [GCP IAM serviceAccounts.signJwt Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_serviceaccounts_signjwt.yml)
  - Detects iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt method for privilege escalation in GCP. This method works by signing well-formed JSON web tokens (JWTs). The script for this method will sign a well-formed JWT and request a new access token belonging to the Service Account with it.
- [GCP iam.roles.update Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_iam_roles_update_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you to update the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you, you will gain the additional privileges, which could be anything you desire.
- [GCP Inbound SSO Profile Created](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_inbound_sso_profile_created_or_updated.yml)
- [GCP K8s IOCActivity](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_ioc_activity.yml)

- [GCP K8s Pod Attached To Node Host Network](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_attached_to_node_host_network.yml)
  - This detection monitor for the creation of pods which are attached to the host's network. This allows a pod to listen to all network traffic for all deployed computer on that particular node and communicate with other compute on the network namespace. Attackers can use this to capture secrets passed in arguments or connections.
- [GCP K8S Pod Create Or Modify Host Path Volume Mount](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_create_or_modify_host_path_vol_mount.yml)
  - This detection monitors for pod creation with a hostPath volume mount. The attachment to a node's volume can allow for privilege escalation through underlying vulnerabilities or it can open up possibilities for data exfiltration or unauthorized file access. It is very rare to see this being a pod requirement.
- [GCP K8s Pod Using Host PID Namespace](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_pod_using_host_pid_namespace.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any pod creation or modification using the host PID namespace. The Host PID namespace enables a pod and its containers to have direct access and share the same view as of the host’s processes. This can offer a powerful escape hatch to the underlying host.
- [GCP K8S Privileged Pod Created](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_privileged_pod_created.yml)
  - Alerts when a user creates privileged pod. These particular pods have full access to the host’s namespace and devices, have the ability to exploit the kernel, have dangerous linux capabilities, and can be a powerful launching point for further attacks. In the event of a successful container escape where a user is operating with root privileges, the attacker retains this role on the node.
- [GCP K8S Service Type NodePort Deployed](../rules/gcp_k8s_rules/gcp_k8s_service_type_node_port_deployed.yml)
  - This detection monitors for any kubernetes service deployed with type node port. A Node Port service allows an attacker to expose a set of pods hosting the service to the internet by opening their port and redirecting traffic here. This can be used to bypass network controls and intercept traffic, creating a direct line to the outside network.

- [GCP Service Account or Keys Created ](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_service_account_or_keys_created.yml)
  - Detects when a service account or key is created manually by a user instead of an automated workflow.
- [GCP serviceusage.apiKeys.create Privilege Escalation](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_serviceusage_apikeys_create_privilege_escalation.yml)
  - Detects serviceusage.apiKeys.create method for privilege escalation in GCP. By default, API Keys are created with no restrictions, which means they have access to the entire GCP project they were created in. We can capitalize on that fact by creating a new API key that may have more privileges than our own user.
- [GCP SQL Config Changes](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_sql_config_changes.yml)
  - Monitoring changes to Sql Instance configuration may reduce time to detect and correct misconfigurations done on sql server.
- [GCP storage hmac keys create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_storage_hmac_keys_create.yml)
  - There is a feature of Cloud Storage, “interoperability”, that provides a way for Cloud Storage to interact with storage offerings from other cloud providers, like AWS S3. As part of that, there are HMAC keys that can be created for both Service Accounts and regular users. We can escalate Cloud Storage permissions by creating an HMAC key for a higher-privileged Service Account.
- [GCP User Added to IAP Protected Service](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_user_added_to_iap_protected_service.yml)
  - A user has been granted access to a IAP protected service.

  - If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you to update the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you, you will gain the additional privileges, which could be anything you desire.
- [GCP.Privilege.Escalation.By.Deployments.Create](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_privilege_escalation_by_deployments_create.yml)
  - Detects privilege escalation in GCP by taking over the deploymentsmanager.deployments.create permission
- [GCS Bucket Made Public](../rules/gcp_audit_rules/gcp_gcs_public.yml)

If secret scanning detects a potential secret, we notify the service provider who issued the secret. The service provider validates the string and then decides whether they should revoke the secret, issue a new secret, or contact you directly. Their action will depend on the associated risks to you or them.
