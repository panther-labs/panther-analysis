Attackers have been observed configuring a second Identity Provider to act as an "impersonation app" to access applications within the compromised Org on behalf of other users.

- [Okta Identity Provider Sign-in](../rules/okta_rules/okta_idp_signin.yml)
  - A user has signed in using a 3rd party Identity Provider. Attackers have been observed configuring a second Identity Provider to act as an "impersonation app" to access applications within the compromised Org on behalf of other users. This second Identity Provider, also controlled by the attacker, would act as a “source” IdP in an inbound federation relationship (sometimes called “Org2Org”) with the target. From this “source” IdP, the threat actor manipulated the username parameter for targeted users in the second “source” Identity Provider to match a real user in the compromised “target” Identity Provider. This provided the ability to Single sign-on (SSO) into applications in the target IdP as the targeted user. Do not use this rule if your organization uses legitimate 3rd-party Identity Providers.

- [Okta Username Above 52 Characters Security Advisory](../queries/okta_queries/okta_52_char_username_threat_hunt.yml)
  - On October 30, 2024, a vulnerability was internally identified in generating the cache key for AD/LDAP DelAuth. The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a combined string of userId + username + password. Under a specific set of conditions, listed below, this could allow users to authenticate by providing the username with the stored cache key of a previous successful authentication. Customers meeting the pre-conditions should investigate their Okta System Log for unexpected authentications from usernames greater than 52 characters between the period of July 23rd, 2024 to October 30th, 2024. https://trust.okta.com/security-advisories/okta-ad-ldap-delegated-authentication-username/
