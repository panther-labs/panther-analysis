Severity: Critical
Description: >
  This policy ensures that S3 buckets are not publicly writeable. Public write access to S3 buckets represents a critical security vulnerability that can lead to multiple attack vectors. Attackers with public write permissions can upload malicious content including malware, ransomware, phishing pages, or illegal content that could implicate your organization. They can delete or overwrite legitimate objects causing data loss or service disruption. Malicious actors can consume storage to generate massive AWS bills through resource exhaustion attacks. Public write access also enables attackers to use your bucket for command and control infrastructure, data staging for other attacks, or cryptocurrency mining operations. Additionally, uploaded malicious files could be served to legitimate users if the bucket hosts a website or application assets, creating supply chain attacks. The S3 bucket could become a vector for malware distribution or be used to host phishing campaigns. This misconfiguration violates security best practices, compliance requirements, and can result in significant financial, reputational, and legal consequences. AWS strongly recommends using S3 Block Public Access settings and restricting bucket access through IAM policies, bucket policies, and ACLs that follow the principle of least privilege.
Runbook: |
  1. Query CloudTrail for s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteObject, and s3:PutObjectAcl events on the bucket in the past 30 days to identify any unauthorized write operations from unfamiliar IP addresses or principals
  2. Remove public write permissions from the bucket's ACL and bucket policy, enable all four S3 Block Public Access settings, and quarantine or delete any malicious objects that were uploaded
  3. Enable S3 server access logging and CloudTrail S3 data events for ongoing monitoring, and review how the public write access was configured to prevent recurrence
