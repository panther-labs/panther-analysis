# ORDERING is a dictionary that describes the required ordering of Web ACL rules for a
# given web acl ID. Map the Web ACL ID to an ordered tuple of Web ACL rule IDs
# Example usage:
# ORDERING{
#   'WebAclId-123': ('FirstRuleId', 'SecondRuleId', 'ThirdRuleId'),
# }
ORDERING = {
    "EXAMPLE_WEB_ACL_ID": ("EXAMPLE_RULE_1_ID", "EXAMPLE_RULE_2_ID"),
