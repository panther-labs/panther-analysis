Description: >
  Detects critical-severity findings from AWS GuardDuty, Amazon's intelligent threat detection service that continuously monitors AWS accounts and workloads for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior. GuardDuty uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify threats such as compromised credentials, cryptocurrency mining, data exfiltration, unauthorized infrastructure deployments, reconnaissance activity, and communication with known malicious IPs. Critical severity findings (9.0 on GuardDuty's 0-9 scale) represent the most serious threats that indicate active compromise, imminent data loss, or ongoing attacks that require immediate investigation and response. These findings often include attack sequences showing multiple MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, connections from malicious infrastructure (Tor nodes, botnets), or high-impact API calls targeting sensitive resources. This rule filters out sample/test data and alerts only on genuine critical findings to enable rapid incident response and minimize potential damage from confirmed threats.
Runbook: |
  1. Look up the finding type in AWS GuardDuty documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_finding-types-active.html, then query CloudTrail for all API calls by the affected principal or resource between service.eventFirstSeen and service.eventLastSeen
  2. For AttackSequence findings, review the description field to identify all MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and sensitive APIs called, then search for each of these API calls in CloudTrail to understand the full attack chain
  3. Search VPC Flow Logs and S3 access logs for connections from the source IPs mentioned in the GuardDuty finding during the timeframe to identify data exfiltration, lateral movement, or persistence mechanisms
