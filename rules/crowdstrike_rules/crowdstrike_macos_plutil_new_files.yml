DisplayName: CrowdStrike MacOS plutil New File Access
Enabled: true
Description: |
  Detects when plutil performs modification operations (insert, replace, remove, create) on plist
  files it hasn't modified in the previous 30 days. Uses behavioral filtering to exclude read-only
  operations (convert, print, lint). This anomaly-based approach reduces noise from legitimate
  repeated operations while catching novel persistence attempts, even in /Applications/.
