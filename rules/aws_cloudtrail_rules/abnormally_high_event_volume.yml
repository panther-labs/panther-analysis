AnalysisType: scheduled_rule
Description: This detection works with a Scheduled Query to store a rolling count of events for given Log Types. A count average is calculated from the list and then compared with the most recent count. If that count exceeds a given threshold, the volume is considered abnormally high. This could represent a DoS attack.
