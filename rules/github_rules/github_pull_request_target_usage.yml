Severity: High
Description: >
  Detects usage of pull_request_target workflows, which run with elevated privileges and can access
  secrets even when triggered by external contributors from forks. These workflows pose security risks
  as they run in the context of the target repository rather than the fork, potentially allowing
  malicious code execution with write access and secrets. Low severity for non-cross-fork PRs.
Runbook: |
  1. Verify the pull_request_target workflow is necessary and properly secured
  2. Check that the workflow doesn't build or run untrusted code from the pull request
  3. Ensure the workflow follows security best practices:
     - Uses explicit checkout with trusted refs
     - Validates inputs and doesn't execute arbitrary code
     - Has minimal required permissions
  4. Review the workflow file for potential security vulnerabilities
  5. Monitor for unusual activity from external contributors
  6. Consider if pull_request event would be sufficient instead
