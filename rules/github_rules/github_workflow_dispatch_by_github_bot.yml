Severity: Info
Description: >
  Detects when a GitHub App server-to-server token (GITHUB_TOKEN) triggers a workflow manually through the workflow_dispatch event,
  creating a new workflow run. This activity may indicate that a possibly previously exfiltrated GITHUB_TOKEN was subsequently
  used to authenticate to the GitHub REST API to trigger a workflow manually. 
  This technique has been observed as the last step in the attack chain of the Nx/S1ngularity supply chain attack.
Runbook: |
  1. Identify the workflow and repository:
     - Review the workflow name and repository from the alert details
     - Check the workflow_run_link in the alert context to view the workflow run details
  2. Review the workflow contents:
     - Examine the workflow file (.github/workflows/) for potentially malicious actions
     - Check for suspicious steps like secret exfiltration or unauthorized deployments
     - Verify the workflow or any scripts used in the workflow itself haven't been recently modified in an unauthorized manner
  3. If suspicious or unauthorized:
     - Immediately cancel the workflow run if it's still in progress
     - Review GitHub audit logs for other activities by this token_id
     - Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed to this workflow
     - Review all recent workflow modifications and runs
