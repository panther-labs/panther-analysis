  MITRE ATT&CK:
    - TA0001:T1195.002  # Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Supply Chain
Severity: Medium
Description: >
  Detects software installation tool user agents in GitHub audit logs that should never 
  directly access GitHub. Package managers like npm, pip, yarn, and system installers 
  operate at the registry level, not GitHub audit level. Their presence indicates:
  1. Supply chain attacks using spoofed user agents to blend in
  2. Compromised systems running installation tools with stolen GitHub tokens  
  3. Malicious automation disguised as legitimate package managers
  
  Based on analysis of GitHub audit logs showing zero legitimate npm/yarn/pip user agents,
  any such patterns are inherently suspicious and warrant immediate investigation.
Runbook: |
  1. Verify the actor and IP address associated with the activity
  2. Check if the GitHub token/credentials used have been compromised
  3. Review all actions performed by this user agent for malicious activity
  4. Investigate if this represents a supply chain attack or credential theft
  5. Consider revoking affected tokens and resetting credentials
  6. Review repository access and recent changes for signs of compromise
