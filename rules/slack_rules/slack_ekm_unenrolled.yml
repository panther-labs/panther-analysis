Severity: Critical
Description: >
  Detects when a Slack workspace is unenrolled from Enterprise Key Management (EKM), representing a severe security degradation by removing customer-controlled encryption. EKM is Slack's enterprise-grade security feature that allows organizations to maintain complete control over their encryption keys by storing them in external key management systems such as AWS KMS, allowing customers to manage key rotation, access policies, and revocation independently of Slack. When EKM is enabled, Slack cannot decrypt workspace data without the customer providing access to their encryption keys, ensuring data remains protected even from Slack itself and providing defense-in-depth for sensitive communications and files. Unenrolling from EKM reverts the workspace to Slack-managed encryption keys, meaning Slack (and by extension, anyone who compromises Slack's infrastructure or obtains legal access to Slack systems) can decrypt all workspace data including messages, files, and metadata. This encryption downgrade has severe implications for organizations in regulated industries (healthcare with HIPAA, financial services with PCI-DSS, government contractors with FedRAMP, any organization with SOC 2 Type II commitments) where customer-controlled encryption is often a mandatory compliance requirement. Legitimate EKM unenrollment is extremely rare and typically only occurs during major organizational changes such as transitioning to a different key management provider, consolidating Slack workspaces during mergers, or troubleshooting critical technical issues with key availability, and should always require executive approval and legal/compliance review. Malicious unenrollment could indicate a compromised Slack administrator account being used to weaken encryption controls in preparation for data exfiltration, an insider threat attempting to gain unauthorized access to encrypted communications, or an attacker attempting to evade detection by accessing data that would otherwise be protected by customer-controlled keys. This action immediately exposes all workspace data to decryption by Slack systems and should trigger immediate investigation to determine authorization, business justification, compliance impact, and whether re-enrollment is required.

Runbook: |
  1. Query Slack audit logs for all actions by actor.user.email in the 30 days around the EKM unenrollment to identify other suspicious administrative actions such as data exports, workspace settings changes, user privilege escalations, or API token creations
  2. Check if the unenrollment occurred outside normal business hours or from an unusual context.ip_address or geographic location that doesn't match the actor's typical access patterns
  3. Search Slack audit logs for data export events, file downloads, or external sharing modifications during the period when EKM was unenrolled to assess potential data exposure while customer-controlled encryption was disabled
