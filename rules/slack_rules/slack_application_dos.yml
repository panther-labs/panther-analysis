Severity: Critical
Description: >
  Detects potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against Slack users through excessive session invalidation by workspace administrators. This rule monitors three admin actions that terminate user sessions: bulk_session_reset_by_admin (resets multiple sessions simultaneously), user_session_invalidated (programmatic session termination), and user_session_reset_by_admin (resets a specific user's session). The rule triggers when any combination of these actions occurs 60 or more times against the same user within a 24-hour period, indicating a targeted attempt to prevent the user from accessing the Slack workspace. Session invalidation forces users to re-authenticate, and repeated invalidation creates a denial of service condition where the targeted user cannot maintain access to their workspace, disrupting communication and productivity. Legitimate use cases for session resets include incident response when an account is suspected of compromise, enforcement of security policies after password changes, or troubleshooting authentication issues, but these typically involve a small number of resets (1-3 times). Reaching the 60-event threshold strongly suggests malicious intent such as a rogue or compromised administrator account being used to harass or exclude a specific user, an insider threat targeting an individual, automated abuse through compromised admin credentials, or an attempt to disrupt business operations by preventing critical personnel from accessing communication channels. This attack can also be part of a broader campaign to cover tracks by preventing security team members from investigating other malicious activities in the workspace. The high threshold (60 events) is designed to minimize false positives from legitimate administrative actions while detecting sustained abuse patterns that represent genuine denial of service attacks.

Runbook: |
  1. Query Slack audit logs for all actions by actor.user.email in the 7 days around this event to identify other malicious activities such as unauthorized user removals, workspace settings changes, data exports, or app installations indicating compromised admin account
  2. Review the total number of session reset events targeting entity.user.name and the time span to calculate the frequency and determine if this represents a sustained denial of service attack
  3. Search Slack audit logs for session reset patterns targeting other users to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader campaign affecting multiple users
