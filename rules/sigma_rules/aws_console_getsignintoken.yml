Description: 'Detects potentially suspicious events involving "GetSigninToken".

  An adversary using the "aws_consoler" tool can leverage this console API to create
  temporary federated credential that help obfuscate which AWS credential is compromised
  (the original access key) and enables the adversary to pivot from the AWS CLI to
  console sessions without the need for MFA using the new access key issued in this
  request.



  Status: test


  Author: Chester Le Bron (@123Le_Bron)

  False Positives: GetSigninToken events will occur when using AWS SSO portal to login
  and will generate false positives if you do not filter for the expected user agent(s),
  see filter. Non-SSO configured roles would be abnormal and should be investigated.'
