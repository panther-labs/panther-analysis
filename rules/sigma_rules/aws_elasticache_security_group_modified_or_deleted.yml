  False Positives: A ElastiCache security group deletion may be done by a system or
  network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname
  should be making changes in your environment. Security Group deletions from unfamiliar
  users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives,
  it can be exempted from the rule.'
