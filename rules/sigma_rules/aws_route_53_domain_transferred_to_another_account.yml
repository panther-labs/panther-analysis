Description: 'Detects when a request has been made to transfer a Route 53 domain to
  another AWS account.


  Status: test


  Author: Elastic, Austin Songer @austinsonger

  False Positives: A domain may be transferred to another AWS account by a system
  or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname
  should be making changes in your environment. Domain transfers from unfamiliar users
  or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it
  can be exempted from the rule.'
