  Status: test


  Author: Austin Songer @austinsonger

  False Positives: A ElastiCache security group may be created by a system or network
  administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should
  be making changes in your environment. Security group creations from unfamiliar
  users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives,
  it can be exempted from the rule.'
