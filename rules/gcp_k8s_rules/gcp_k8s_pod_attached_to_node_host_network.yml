Description: This detection monitor for the creation of pods which are attached to the host's network. 
  This allows a pod to listen to all network traffic for all deployed computer on that particular node and 
  communicate with other compute on the network namespace. Attackers can use this to capture secrets passed in 
  arguments or connections.
Reports:
    MITRE ATT&CK:
        - TA0004:T1611  # Escape to Host
Runbook: Investigate a reason of creating a pod which is attached to the host's network. Advise that it is discouraged 
  practice. Create ticket if appropriate.
