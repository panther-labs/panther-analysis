Description: >-
  If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you
  to update the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you,
  you will gain the additional privileges, which could be anything you desire.

  Confirm this was authorized and necessary behavior. This is not a vulnerability
  in GCP, it is a vulnerability in how GCP environment is configured, so it is necessary
  to be aware of these attack vectors and to defend against them. It’s also important
  to remember that privilege escalation does not necessarily need to pass through
  the IAM service to be effective. Make sure to follow the principle of least-privilege
  in your environments to help mitigate these security risks.
