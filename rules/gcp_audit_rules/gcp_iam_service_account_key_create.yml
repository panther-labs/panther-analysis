DisplayName: "GCP.Iam.ServiceAccountKeys.Create"
Description: If your user is assigned a custom IAM role, then iam.roles.update will allow you to update 
  the “includedPermissons” on that role. Because it is assigned to you, you will gain the additional privileges, 
  which could be anything you desire.

Runbook: Confirm this was authorized and necessary behavior. This is not a vulnerability in GCP, it is a vulnerability 
  in how GCP environment is configured, so it is necessary to be aware of these attack vectors and to defend against 
  them. It’s also important to remember that privilege escalation does not necessarily need to pass through the 
  IAM service to be effective. Make sure to follow the principle of least-privilege in your environments to help 
  mitigate these security risks.
