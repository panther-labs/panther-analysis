# Panther CLI Tool
`panther-cli` is a Python command line interface for testing and packaging Panther Policies and Rules. Policies define the compliant and secure state of a cloud Resource, whereas Rules perform analysis on log data.

## Installation

Setup your environment:

```bash
$ make venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ make deps
```

Use the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager (locally for now) to install `panther-cli`.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Writing Policies

Each Panther Policy consists of a Python body and a YAML or JSON specification file.

In the Python body, returning a value of `True` indicates the resource being evaluated is compliant. Returning a value of `False` indicates the resource is non-compliant, and an alert may be sent or an auto-remediation may be performed as a result.

The specification file defines the attributes of the Policy. This includes settings such as `Enabled`, `Severity`, and `ResourceTypes`, as well as metadata such as `DisplayName`, `Tags`, and `Runbook`. See the [Writing Local Policies](https://docs.runpanther.io/policies/writing-local) documentation for more details on what fields may be present, and how they are configured. 

`example_policy.py`
```python
def policy(resource):
  return True
```

`example_policy.yml`
```yaml
AnalysisType: policy
Enabled: true
Filename: example_policy.py
PolicyID: Example.Policy.01
ResourceTypes:
  - Resource.Type.Here
Severity: Low
DisplayName: Example Policy to Check the Format of the Spec
Tags:
  - Tags
  - Go
  - Here
Runbook: Find out who changed the spec format.
Reference: https://www.link-to-info.io
Tests:
  -
    Name: Name to describe our first test.
    Schema: Resource.Type.Here
    ExpectedResult: true/false
    Resource:
      Key: Values
      For: Our Resource
      Based: On the Schema
```

The requirements for the Policy body and specification files are listed below.

The Python body MUST:
  - Be valid Python3
  - Define a function `policy` that accepts one argument
  - Return a `bool` from the `policy` function

The Python body SHOULD:
  - Name the argument to the `policy` function `resource`

The Python body MAY:
  - Import standard Python3 libraries
  - Define additional helper functions as needed
  - Define variables and classes outside the scope of the `policy` function

The specification file MUST:
  - Be valid JSON/YAML
  - Define an `AnalysisType` field with the value `policy`
  - Define the additional following fields:
    - Enabled
    - FileName
    - PolicyID
    - ResourceTypes
    - Severity 

## Included Policies

We include the following policy bundles:

  - CIS
    - These policies cover the CIS benchmarks for AWS Cloud Infrastructure, specifically controls 1.x, 2.x, and 4.x. These policies can help an organization check compliance with CIS recommended best practices.
  - Managed
    - These policies cover many of the similar concerns as the AWS Config Managed rules. These policies can help an organization meet baseline good practice configurations as recommended by AWS.
  - S3
    - These policies cover S3 security configurations in general. These policies can help an organization ensure best security practices are in use with regards to their S3 buckets.

## Writing Rules

Rules are very similar to Policies, and require a similar Python body and JSON or YAML specification file as Policies require.

One very important distinction between Policies and Rules is the meaning of the return value. For Rules, returning a value of `False` indicates that the event being evaluated should not be alerted on. Returning a value of `True` indicates that the event is suspicious, and an alert may be sent or an auto-remediation may be performed as a result.

`example_rule.py`
```python
def rule(event):
  return False
```

`example_rule.yml`
```yaml
AnalysisType: rule 
Enabled: true
Filename: example_rule.py
PolicyID: Example.Rule.01
ResourceTypes:
  - Log.Type.Here
Severity: Low
DisplayName: Example Rule to Check the Format of the Spec
Tags:
  - Tags
  - Go
  - Here
Runbook: Find out who changed the spec format.
Reference: https://www.link-to-info.io
Tests:
  -
    Name: Name to describe our first test.
    ResourceType: Log.Type.Here
    ExpectedResult: true/false
    Resource:
      Key: Values
      For: Our Log
      Based: On the Schema
```

The requirements for the Rule body and specification files are listed below.

The Python body MUST:
  - Be valid Python3
  - Define a function `rule` that accepts one argument
  - Return a `bool` from the `rule` function

The Python body SHOULD:
  - Name the argument to the `rule` function `event`

The Python body MAY:
  - Import standard Python3 libraries
  - Define additional helper functions as needed
  - Define variables and classes outside the scope of the `rule` function

The specification file MUST:
  - Be valid JSON/YAML
  - Define an `AnalysisType` field with the value `rule`
  - Define the additional following fields:
    - Enabled
    - FileName
    - PolicyID
    - ResourceTypes
    - Severity 

## Included Rules

We include the following rule bundles:

  - CIS
    - These rules monitor CloudTrail log data and cover the CIS benchmarks for AWS Cloud Infrastructure, specifically controls 3.x. These rules can help an organization ensure compliance with CIS recommended best practices.
  - S3 Access Logs
    - These rules monitor S3 access logs, and can serve as examples for additional S3 access log related rules
  - VPC Flow Logs
    - These rules monitor VPC Flow Logs, and can serve as examples for additional VPC flow log related rules.
